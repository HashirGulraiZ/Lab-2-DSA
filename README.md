Task#1:
Abstract class named List
Functionalities:
a.	virtual void addElementAtFirstIndex(Type) = 0;  
// Should add the element at the first position of the List 
b.	virtual void addElementAtLastIndex(Type) = 0;  
// Should add the element at the last position of the List 
c.	virtual Type removeElementFromEnd() = 0;  
// Should remove the element from the last position of the 
List 
d.	virtual void removeElementFromStart() = 0;  
//Should remove the element from the first position of the 
List 

Task#2:
Menu Based System:

A class named as MyList, having the following additional functionalities: 
•	bool empty(): Returns whether the MyList is empty or not 
•	bool 	full(): 	Returns 	whether 	the 	MyList 	is 	full 	or 	not int size(): Returns the current size of the MyList  
•	bool insertAt(int index, T value): Adds a value at the index passed to the function, returns 	true 	if 	the 	index 	is 	present 	and 	value 	is 	added 	else 	returns 	false.  Type last(): Returns the last element of the MyList  
•	bool search(Type): Returns true if the searched value is present in the list else returns false 
•	Write a parameterized constructor with default arguments for the above class. 
•	Write a copy constructor for the above class. 
•	Write destructor for the above class. 

Task#3:
Menu Based System:

A class named as CustomList, having the following additional functionalities: 
•	Type sum_ofPrime():  It finds prime numbers in the list and calculates and returns the sum of all prime numbers present in list. 
•	Type secondMaxEven(): It finds and returns the second maximum even number present in list. 
•	Type secondMinOdd(): It finds and returns the second minimum odd number present in list. 
•	void printDuplicates(): It finds and displays all the numbers which occur more than once. 
•	void rotateClockwaise( int r): It divides the list into two parts (halves the list), and rotate both parts “r” times in clockwise direction 
•	void rotateanitclockwaise( int rt) : It divides the list into two parts (halves the list), and rotate both parts “rt” times in the anti-clockwise direction 
•	Write a parameterized constructor with default arguments for the above class. 
•	Write a copy constructor for the above class. 
•	Write destructor for the above class.
